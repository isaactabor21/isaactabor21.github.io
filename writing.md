It shows my ability to synthesize research, construct clear arguments, and communicate legal and policy issues effectively

[Economic Research Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mIo-WqYK19XfrHNW0HrebUQyr84FjDQc/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112182373098613066526&rtpof=true&sd=true) (ECON 3720, UVA) - A group project analyzing the effects of remote work on labor productivity. While it is student-level work and not without limitations, it demonstrates my experience with economic empirical research papers, including the structure, the significance of appropriately interpreting results, and discussing methodological limitations.

We explored an XGBoost machine learning model trained on regular-season performance differentials to predict march madness outcomes. In the final paper, we explain our data, methodlogy, and results.
