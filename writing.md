[Policy Essay on Environmental Racism](https://docs.google.com/document/d/140_Ngm3iseXMRIfiEYW0jXzAWka3Wvgt-MeIvsUS2Vk/edit?usp=sharing) (Environmental Law and Policy, Boston College) â€“ I wrote this independently, examining the disproportionate impact of environmental practices on marginalized communities. It shows my ability to synthesize research, construct clear arguments, and communicate legal and policy issues effectively

[Economic Research Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mIo-WqYK19XfrHNW0HrebUQyr84FjDQc/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112182373098613066526&rtpof=true&sd=true) (ECON 3720, UVA) - A group project analyzing the effects of remote work on labor productivity. While it is student-level work and not without limitations, it demonstrates my experience with economic empirical research papers, including the structure, the significance of appropriately interpreting results, and discussing methodological limitations.

More available upon request including papers in sociology (Latinos in the US Military), political theory (Tocqueville, Heclo, and the Common Good: Understanding Division in Contemporary America), creative writing, news writing, psychology and more.
