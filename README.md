## About Me

Hi! My name is Isaac Tabor. I am currently obtaining my M.S. Data Science from the University of Virginia, where I also earned a B.A. Economics with Distinction, and minors in Data Science and Business Spanish. 

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, staying active, reading, watching sports and spending time outdoors. I am also passionate about traveling, music and languages, especially Spanish and French because I grew up speaking Spanish with my mother who is from Chile, and attending French Immersion in my home state of Minnesota!
